# Opentrons

Most codes and labware definitions are to be used with Opentrons OT2.
Feel free to copy and edit the protocols and labware definition and fork the repo to add your own codes.

The protocols are primarily aimed at solution processing of Perovskite materials, however can be used for other similar workflows.

The labware positions generator is currently made to be used alongside the labware generator for the part of the definition that is
not positions. Planning to extend it to generate labware definitions completely. 


Currently working on hacking into the robot to make it 
A. Take in values directly from the excel files
B. Take over the internal RasPi to make OT2 talk to other robots/peripheral devices e.g. cameras and spectrometers
